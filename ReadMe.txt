First of all, you will need to download the dataset, which are the .csv files in the link below.

MNIST .csv link: 
https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1pTG5a4QXBTPdMqXAZ1GaI89tnxx_P57M?usp=sharing

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
After you downloaded and all .m files are on the SAME folder, 
you should run the "MNIST_train".

Be sure that all functions are in the same folder (the functions are the .m files).
If the functions are not in the folder, MATLAB wont be able to use them.

After running the MNIST_train, you will have the model of the neural network and it will be
saved in .m files (you can see that in the end of the code).

After that, you can run MNIST_test, which will load the model you've trained to validate
it.
